# Black Friday Campaign Preparation Agent

## What This Agent Does

The Black Friday Campaign Preparation Agent is a **read-only analysis tool** that helps you prepare your Google Ads campaigns for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holiday shopping season (BFCM).

**Important: This agent NEVER makes changes to your campaigns.** It only reads your historical and current data to provide recommendations. You remain in full control of all decisions.

## Why You Can Trust This Agent

### Read-Only Access
- **No writes**: Cannot modify budgets, bids, or campaign settings
- **No automation**: Cannot pause, enable, or delete campaigns
- **No API mutations**: Only uses Google Ads API `SELECT` queries (read operations)
- **Data analysis only**: Analyzes your data and provides recommendations YOU implement

### Transparency
- All GAQL queries are documented in the agent file
- You can review exactly what data it accesses
- Recommendations are suggestions, not actions
- Full audit trail of what data was analyzed

### Privacy
- Data stays local to your Claude Code session
- No external API calls (uses your configured MCP server)
- No data sent to third parties
- Analysis happens on your machine

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Historical Data Collection
The agent queries your Google Ads account for past Black Friday performance (typically Nov 20 - Dec 5 from previous years):

**Data Retrieved:**
- Campaign names and IDs
- Daily impressions, clicks, conversions
- Daily spend (cost_micros)
- Conversion values
- Average CPC

**GAQL Query Used:**
```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  campaign.id,
  segments.date,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.conversions_value,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.average_cpc
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date BETWEEN 'YYYY-11-20' AND 'YYYY-12-05'
ORDER BY segments.date
```

**Why This Data?**
- Shows which campaigns performed well during previous BFCM periods
- Helps calculate traffic surges (e.g., "traffic was 3x normal")
- Identifies your highest-ROI campaigns for budget prioritization

#### 2. Current Performance Baseline
The agent analyzes your current campaign setup (last 30 days):

**Data Retrieved:**
- Active campaigns and their budgets
- Current spend rates and conversion performance
- Impression share (how much traffic you're capturing)
- Budget lost impression share (traffic lost due to budget limits)
- Ad approval status

**GAQL Query Used:**
```sql
SELECT
  campaign.name,
  campaign.id,
  campaign.status,
  campaign.advertising_channel_type,
  campaign_budget.amount_micros,
  campaign_budget.period,
  metrics.impressions,
  metrics.clicks,
  metrics.conversions,
  metrics.cost_micros,
  metrics.search_impression_share,
  metrics.search_budget_lost_impression_share
FROM campaign
WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
  AND campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
```

**Why This Data?**
- Establishes "normal" performance baseline
- Identifies campaigns already hitting budget limits
- Shows current ROAS for budget prioritization
- Reveals which campaigns are ready vs. need work

#### 3. Analysis & Calculations

The agent performs these calculations **locally in Claude Code**:

**Traffic Surge Calculation:**
```
BFCM Daily Impressions / Normal Daily Impressions = Traffic Multiplier
Example: 300,000 / 100,000 = 3x traffic surge
```

**Budget Recommendations:**
```
Current Daily Budget √ó Traffic Multiplier = Recommended BFCM Budget
Example: $1,000 √ó 3 = $3,000 recommended
```

**ROI-Based Prioritization:**
```
Historical BFCM ROAS by Campaign
Rank campaigns by ROAS
Allocate more budget to high-ROAS campaigns
```

**Budget Sufficiency Check:**
```
If (Impression Share Lost to Budget > 20%) {
  Flag as "Will definitely run out of budget"
}
```

#### 4. Recommendation Generation

Based on the analysis, the agent creates:

**Executive Summary:**
- Overall readiness score (1-10)
- Total budget needed
- Top 3 priorities
- Key risks

**Budget Table:**
```
| Campaign       | Current Budget | Recommended | Increase | Rationale        |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Search - Brand | $1,000        | $3,000      | +200%    | 3x traffic surge |
| Display        | $500          | $750        | +50%     | Lower priority   |
```

**Preparation Checklist:**
- Critical tasks (e.g., "Increase Budget on Campaign X by Nov 20")
- Important optimizations (e.g., "Add seasonal keywords")
- Nice-to-have improvements (e.g., "Create countdown ads")

**Monitoring Schedule:**
- When to check performance daily vs. hourly
- Which metrics to watch closely
- Alert thresholds (e.g., "If spend hits 80% of daily budget by 2pm...")

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Will this agent make changes to my account?
**A:** No. It's read-only. All recommendations require your manual implementation.

### Q: How accurate are the budget recommendations?
**A:** Based on your historical data. If last year showed 3x traffic surge, it recommends budgets for similar surge. Accuracy depends on consistency of market conditions.

### Q: What if I don't have historical BFCM data?
**A:** Agent uses industry benchmarks (typically 2-3x normal traffic). Recommendations will be more conservative and less personalized.

### Q: Can I use this for other seasonal events?
**A:** Yes! While optimized for BFCM, you can adapt it for:
- Christmas/Holiday season
- Back to School
- Valentine's Day
- Any seasonal peak period

Just specify the dates when asking.

### Q: How long does the analysis take?
**A:** Typically 30-60 seconds to pull data and generate recommendations. Depends on account size and date ranges.

### Q: Can I run this multiple times?
**A:** Yes! Run it weekly as you approach BFCM to track preparation progress.

### Q: What if my account has hundreds of campaigns?
**A:** Agent analyzes all campaigns but focuses recommendations on top performers (by spend or ROAS). You can ask it to focus on specific campaign types if needed.

### Q: Is this better than a consultant?
**A:** It complements consultants, not replaces them. Provides data-driven analysis quickly. Consultants add strategic judgment, market knowledge, and implementation support.

### Q: Can I share the output with my team?
**A:** Yes! The report is yours to share. You can copy the output and distribute as needed.

### Q: What about Performance Max campaigns?
**A:** Agent analyzes PMax campaigns same as others. However, detailed asset group analysis is limited by current API capabilities. (Full PMax reporting coming in future API updates.)
